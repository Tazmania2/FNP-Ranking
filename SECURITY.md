# Security Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Chicken Race Ranking application and provides guidelines for maintaining security best practices.

## Environment Variables

### Required Environment Variables

All sensitive configuration must be provided through environment variables:

- `VITE_FUNIFIER_SERVER_URL`: Your Funifier server URL
- `VITE_FUNIFIER_API_KEY`: Your Funifier API key
- `VITE_FUNIFIER_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Funifier Basic authentication token

### Security Requirements

1. **Never commit sensitive data**: API keys, tokens, and credentials must never be committed to version control
2. **Use environment variables**: All sensitive configuration must use environment variables
3. **Validate configuration**: The application validates all API configuration before use
4. **Use placeholder values**: Documentation and examples must use placeholder values only

## Input Validation and XSS Protection

### Implemented Protections

1. **Input Sanitization**: All user-provided data is sanitized using the validation utilities
2. **HTML Escaping**: Player names and data are automatically escaped by React
3. **No dangerouslySetInnerHTML**: The application does not use dangerouslySetInnerHTML
4. **API Response Validation**: All API responses are validated and sanitized

### Validation Functions

The application includes validation utilities in `src/utils/validation.ts`:

- `sanitizeString()`: Removes HTML tags and dangerous characters
- `validatePlayerName()`: Validates and sanitizes player names
- `validateNumber()`: Validates numeric inputs
- `validateUrl()`: Validates URL inputs
- `validateApiConfig()`: Validates API configuration

## Security Headers

### Implemented Headers

The application implements comprehensive security headers via Vercel configuration:

- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts resource loading and prevents XSS
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables browser XSS protection
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser features

## API Security

### Authentication

- Uses Basic authentication with Funifier API
- Tokens are stored securely in environment variables
- Authentication headers are properly configured

### Request Security

- 10-second timeout on all requests
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Input validation on all API parameters

## Deployment Security

### Vercel Configuration

- Environment variables are encrypted and secure
- HTTPS is enforced for all connections
- Preview deployments can be password protected
- Build artifacts exclude sensitive information

### CI/CD Security

- Automated checks for hardcoded credentials
- Security scanning in GitHub Actions
- Verification scripts check for sensitive data exposure

## File Security

### .gitignore Configuration

The following files and patterns are excluded from version control:

- Environment files (`.env*`)
- Security files (`*.key`, `*.pem`, `secrets/`)
- Build artifacts and temporary files
- Editor and OS specific files

### Sensitive File Patterns

Never commit files containing:
- API keys or tokens
- Passwords or secrets
- Private keys or certificates
- Configuration with sensitive data

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Automated Checks

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Checks for hardcoded credentials in source code
2. **Deployment Verification**: Validates that sensitive data is not exposed in build
3. **Security Headers**: Verifies proper security header configuration

### Manual Auditing

Regular security audits should include:

1. Review of environment variable usage
2. Validation of input sanitization
3. Check for new security vulnerabilities
4. Update of security dependencies

## Incident Response

### If Credentials Are Exposed

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Rotate all exposed API keys and tokens
   - Update environment variables in Vercel
   - Review git history for exposure scope

2. **Investigation**:
   - Identify how credentials were exposed
   - Check for unauthorized API usage
   - Review access logs if available

3. **Prevention**:
   - Update security checks to prevent similar exposure
   - Review and update documentation
   - Train team on security best practices

## Security Updates

### Dependencies

- Regularly update all dependencies
- Monitor security advisories
- Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Update Node.js and build tools

### Configuration

- Review security headers periodically
- Update CSP policies as needed
- Monitor for new security best practices
- Update validation rules as required
